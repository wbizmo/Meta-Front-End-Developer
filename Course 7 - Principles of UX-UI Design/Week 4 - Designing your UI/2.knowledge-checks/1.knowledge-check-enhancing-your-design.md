# Knowledge check: Enhancing your design

1. Which of these are design elements? Select all that apply. 
    - Width
    - Negative space
    - Depth
    - Lines
    ```
    Answer: Negative space
            Depth
            Lines
    Explanation: Negative space is the "space in between" or the area between or around other elements that form their shape.
                 Depth is an essential and exciting principle. You can create a sense of depth and the illusion that your design extends beyond the second dimension, even with the flattest of mediums.
                 Lines are any linear marks, so if you think about it, lines include nearly everything. They even include the words and letters you are reading that consist of thousands of curved, angled and straight lines.
